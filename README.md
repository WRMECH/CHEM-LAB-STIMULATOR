# CHEM-LAB-STIMULATOR

# ðŸ§ª Virtual Chemistry Lab Simulator

This project provides an interactive web-based virtual chemistry lab simulator, built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to simulate basic chemical reactions and perform a simplified acid-base titration experiment, all presented with a vibrant "neon" aesthetic and dynamic visual feedback.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **General Chemical Mixing:** Select any two chemicals from a predefined list and observe their simulated reaction, including product formation and a detailed reaction log.
*   **Acid-Base Titration Experiment:** Simulate a titration process by selecting an acid, a base, and an indicator. Witness the solution's color change as the titrant is added drop by drop, indicating the equivalence point.
*   **Vibrant Neon Visuals:** The entire application features a dark theme with glowing "neon" colors for chemicals and UI elements, creating a visually striking and immersive experience.
*   **Dynamic Animations:** Experience simulated mixing and reaction processes with progress bars and dynamic color changes in the chemical display boxes.
*   **Molecular Structure Visualization:** RDKit is integrated to display 2D molecular structures of selected chemicals.
*   **Detailed Reaction Logs:** Each simulation provides a log explaining the type of reaction, products formed, and key observations.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The core programming language for the application logic.
*   **Streamlit:** A powerful open-source framework for building interactive web applications purely in Python.
*   **RDKit:** A cheminformatics software package used for generating and visualizing molecular structures.
*   **`time` module:** Used for simulating delays and animations.

## ðŸ’» Setup and Running the Project

Follow these steps to get the Virtual Chemistry Lab Simulator up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### Recommended Setup (Using Virtual Environment)

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system's Python installation.

1.  **Open your Terminal (or Command Prompt/VS Code Integrated Terminal).**

2.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    Make sure you are in the `chem lab` directory where your `scripts` folder is located.
    ```bash
    cd /Users/shivamsingh/Desktop/chem\ lab # Adjust this path to your actual project directory
